## Sensor Enclosure 3D Design Files

These are the .stl design files I used for the enclosure shown in the video.  One is the base enclosure and the other is the lid.

They are designed for the GY-302 breakout board and a Wemos D1 Mini.  Use of other boards will likely require changes to the enclosure design.

These were printed using PLA with supports.  Do note that minimal support material should be used for the 'slot' that holds the GY-302, as this support material can be a challenge to remove after printing.
